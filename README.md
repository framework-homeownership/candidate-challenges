## Exercise Instructions
This exercise has 2 parts, the first one is a coding challenge that requires some Java knowledge. The second part is question and answer based, where your output will be either plain text, diagrams, or a combination of both. All output should be included in your repository branch.

### Part 1: Coding Challenge
- Detailed instructions are in the [Code challenge README.md](https://github.com/framework-homeownership/candidate-challenges/blob/main/challenge/README.md) in the `challenge/` directory.
- Follow the instructions in the above README.
- All code changes should be done in the `challenge/` directory

### Part 2: Question and Answer
- Detailed instructions are in the [QUESTIONS.md](https://github.com/framework-homeownership/candidate-challenges/blob/main/questions/QUESTIONS.md) file in the `questions/` directory.
- You can answer the questions inline in `QUESTIONS.md` or in a separate file of your choosing.
- All of your answers should be somewhere in the `questions/` directory.


Some final notes:
- Keep commits small, there should not just be one big commit at the end with all your code.
- Limit your time working on this to ~3 hours maximum. Don't spend extra time trying to cover every edge case in testing or expanding the code beyond what is requested.
- If you run into any blockers along the way or need to ask a question, please email both Matt and Dan:
    - <matt@frameworkhomeownership.org>
    - <dan@frameworkhomeownership.org>
