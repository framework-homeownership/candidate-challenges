# Exercise Questions
This is the second part of the take home exericse, intended to be completed after the coding challenge. If you have not yet completed the coding challenge, start by following the instructions in the [Code challenge README](https://github.com/framework-homeownership/candidate-challenges/blob/main/challenge/README.md) in the `challenge/` directory of this repository and return to this section after.

This part of the exercise will provide a theoretical scenario, building off of the work you have done for the coding exercise, and ask some questions around that scenario.

## Scenario
This scenario will expand on the work you did for the Library module, but will NOT require any new code to be written. The output from this section will be written answers to questions and some documentation. You are welcome to email any of your contacts at Framework to ask any questions you have about the exercise. These questions are intended to be open-ended, please provide as much or as little detail as is you think relevant.

Now that the code changes to the Library module are complete, you have been tasked with designing a new User service to track which Library resources an individual has checked out, as well as restricting access to users without an account. At a minimum this service will need to be comprised of a new API and new table(s) in a pre-existing RDBMS. The intent is to launch this new service on a cloud provider (of your choice), with the following requirements:
- Communicates with a backend database.
- Caching mechanism for data retrieved from RDBMS.
- Should have redundancy and high availability.
- Calls to API must be authenticated and authorized.
- Average request load to API expected to be ~50 calls per minute, but with spikes to ~10,000,000 requests per minute a few times per month. These spikes should be handled without manual intervention.
- After the initial deployments, subsequent ones should be fairly automated.


Question 1. How would you design the data model for this new service, and how would it relate to the Library? Please provide some sort of schema or diagram and document any concerns/considerations you made that are not directly reflected in your documentation. Documentation can be hand drawn or generated with a tool of your choice.

Question 2. How would you control access to Library content? Describe what this mechanism would look like and list any services you would use to accomplish this goal.

Question 3. How would you ensure your service would continue functioning if the datacenter it was deployed in had a catastrophic failure and was completely wiped off the map.

Question 4. Describe how you would approach building a dynamically scalable API. Are there any prerequisites for the service code for this to work?

Question 5. Provide a diagram of how you envision the architecture for this to be deployed in a cloud provider. Any provider you choose is acceptable, just be sure to document the services/tools you would be using. Diagrams can be hand drawn or generated by a tool of your choice.

Question 6. After a successful launch of your brand new service (congrats!) it runs flawlessly for a few months. Then suddenly, every Tuesday and Thursday the service falls over and requires manual intervention to get it running again. You don't see any obvious problems. How would you go about troubleshooting this issue? Detail your approach and any tools/services you would use to accomplish this task.

Question 7. Are there any requirements that have not been given as part of this scenario that you would consider essential and push to have included for any service being developed?
